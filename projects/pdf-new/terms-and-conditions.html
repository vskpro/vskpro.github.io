                            either in person or through any other media and alone (except for one assistant for each party)
                            and shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If such representatives in such meeting
                            cannot resolve the disputes, the parties agree that they shall, if requested in writing by either
                            party, meet within thirty (30) days after such written notification for one day with an impartial
                            mediator and consider dispute resolution alternatives other than litigation. The mediation will
                            be treated as a settlement discussion and therefore will be confidential and may not be used
                            in a later evidentiary proceeding. The mediator may not testify for either party in any later
                            proceeding relating to the dispute. No recording or transcript shall be made of the mediation
                            proceedings. Each party will bear its own costs in the mediation. The parties will share the
                            Fees and expenses of the mediator equally. If an alternative method of dispute resolution is
                            not agreed upon within thirty (30) days after the one-day mediation, either party may invoke
                            arbitration proceedings for resolution of disputes.</p>
