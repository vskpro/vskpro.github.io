                            Log on to our website and choose the weight range, life stage and recipe category. You will be directed to a webpage which
                            shows the exact daily quantity of the recipe and the right mix that will go with it perfectly.
                            The QTM recipe making guidelines will also be available in the same page. Take a print out of
                            it and paste it near your kitchen. Since, the website is available in 6 regional languages, it
                            is easy to understand. Then, add the mix to your shopping cart or consult your nearest pet store/your
                            veterinary doctor/direct retailer/pet ambassador. Then, cook the QTM recipe, add the mix as per

                            variables tell the program what nutrient levels are right for your pet as well as how many calories

                            Many seasonings are untested on dogs and cats for safety. For example, onions and garlic are toxic to dogs and cats at levels
                            that are well-tolerated by people. A worry would be that adding rarely used seasonings might
                            pose a health risk.

                            We have made the pet's recipe specific because the nutrient content of the ingredients can differ significantly by cooking
                            procedure, cut (specific to meat), inclusion of skin (such as with poultry or potatoes), etc.
                            We have been as specific as possible in our instructions, just to ensure that your pet's diet
                            has all the desired nutrients and intended benefits. However, a variation in quantity of 5 to
                            10% is perfectly fine.

                            Pet diet fix mix should not be mixed with packaged pet food. On its own, pet diet fix mix has all the necessary nutrients
                            in it. Hence, adding it to the packaged food will result in excess of nutrients and is not good
                            for your pet. It should only be mixed with the recommended home pet food recipe, in the exact

                            Most of the pet owners in India are already feeding both packaged food and home food in a day. To elaborate, they are already
                            feeding packaged food for 1 portion and home food for another portion in a day. This system is
                            being followed to balance the dehydration issue, increased digestibility and also to cut down
                            the huge costs of buying packaged pet food. You can use pet diet fix in this way too by proportionately
                            reducing the suggested quantities of both packaged food and pet diet fix home food every day.
                            When in doubt, kindly consult your veterinarian.

                            everyday human food preparations and pet home food preparations. Hence, they are the easiest
                            recipes to cook and serve your beloved pet. On the other hand, you can add pet diet fix in a
