# page-slider-js
A page slider in vanilla JS. Made famous by Apple.com a good while ago. I made this because I couldn't find a decent one in pure vanilla javascript. Oh, it's also responsive.

The script will add the ID selector of each slide to the URL when you scroll to it. When the page loads and a valid hash is in the URL, the script will scroll to that slide.
